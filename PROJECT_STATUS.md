## Known Limitations and Solutions

### GitHub Actions Permission Issues
**Status**: Documented with multiple solution paths
**Impact**: Documentation auto-commit and SARIF uploads may require additional configuration
**Solutions**: 
- Use Personal Access Token for repository write access
- Configure GitHub App for enhanced permissions
- Disable automatic git push for documentation updates

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Repository Setup**:
   - Configure environment protection rules in GitHub Settings
   - Add required secrets (AZURE_CREDENTIALS, optional PAT_TOKEN)
   - Enable branch protection on main branch

2. **Azure Environment**:
   - Create Azure service principal with appropriate permissions
   - Configure Azure subscriptions for each environment
   - Set up remote state storage containers

3. **Team Onboarding**:
   - Review LEARNING_GUIDE.md for progressive skill building
   - Practice with development environment first
   - Establish code review processes for infrastructure changes

4. **Production Deployment**:
   - Test CI/CD pipeline with development environment
   - Configure monitoring and alerting for infrastructure
   - Establish incident response procedures
